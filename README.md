# hfsolver
hfsolver: a numerical solver for the Hartree-Fock equation of state of a homogeneous Bose gas

## Installation
The recommended way is to install the pacage from GitHub using `pip`

    pip install --user git+https://github.com/carmelom/hfsolver.git

or to manually clone the repo.

## Examples
[hfsolver_example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/carmelom/hfsolver/blob/master/examples/hfsolver_example.ipynb)

A notebook containing some examples, like
* basic usage of the `solver` function
* solution in a harmonic potential
* conversion plots for the physical parameters ($\mu_0$, $T$) vs the reduced ones

For a detailed explanation of the parameters and the (fairly simple) algorithm, inspect the code (xD)! Or refer to the [docs](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/carmelom/hfsolver/blob/master/doc) section (under construction).
